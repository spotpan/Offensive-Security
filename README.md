#Tools Used#
Primarily done using Python with the pwntools library, which is an absolutely amazing library for CTF's. For exploring and understanding binaries I used both Binary Ninja and Ghidra, both of which I recommend and have their own individual strengths and weaknesses. Some weeks I occasionally used other tools I found in my own research, but these are in the respective folders.
